    "## Basic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are a fundamental part of error handling in Python. They represent exceptional conditions or errors that occur during the execution of a program. Here are some commonly encountered exceptions and their basic types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NameError**: Raised when a local or global name is not found or not defined.\n",
    "2. **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an invalid value.\n",
    "3. **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.\n",
    "4. **SyntaxError**: Raised when there is a syntax error in the code.\n",
    "5. **OSError**: Raised when a system-related error occurs, such as a file or directory not found, permission issues, or disk full.\n",
    "6. **RuntimeError**: Raised when a generic runtime error occurs that doesn't fit into any specific exception category.\n",
    "7. **Exception**: The base class for all exceptions. It can be used to catch any exception if specific exception types are not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of commonly encountered exceptions in Python. Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions, and you can also create custom exceptions by deriving from the base `Exception` class to handle specific error conditions in your code. Handling exceptions properly helps to gracefully recover from errors and improve the robustness of your programs."

    "## User-defined exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can define your own custom exceptions to handle specific types of errors or exceptional conditions in your code. User-defined exceptions allow you to create a hierarchy of exceptions that can be raised and caught within your program. Here's how you can define and use user-defined exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a custom exception class:\n",
    "   To define a user-defined exception, you need to create a new class that inherits from the base `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyException(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, we've defined a custom exception class called `MyException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Raising a custom exception:\n",
    "   You can raise a custom exception using the `raise` statement. By raising an exception, you indicate that a specific error or exceptional condition has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   raise MyException(\"An error occurred.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, we're raising an instance of the `MyException` class with a specific error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Catching a custom exception:\n",
    "   To handle a specific custom exception, you can use a `try`...`except` block and catch the exception using its class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise MyException\n",
    "       raise MyException(\"An error occurred.\")\n",
    "   except MyException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle the exception\n",
    "       print(\"Custom exception caught:\", str(e))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, we catch the `MyException` and handle it by printing the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining and using custom exceptions, you can create more expressive and meaningful error handling in your code. Custom exceptions allow you to categorize and handle different types of errors separately, improving the clarity and maintainability of your code."

    "## BaseException vs Exception differences\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both `BaseException` and `Exception` are base classes for exceptions, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance:\n",
    "   - `BaseException` is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. It includes system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, and `GeneratorExit`, as well as other exceptions like `StopIteration` and `Exception` itself.\n",
    "   - `Exception` is a subclass of `BaseException` and serves as the base class for user-defined exceptions and most other built-in exceptions. It provides a more specific base for catching and handling general exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catching exceptions:\n",
    "   - `BaseException` catches all exceptions, including system-level exceptions like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`. It is generally not recommended to catch `BaseException` directly unless you have a specific reason to handle all types of exceptions.\n",
    "   - `Exception` catches most common exceptions that you're likely to encounter in your code, excluding system-level exceptions. It is the recommended base class for catching and handling exceptions in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exception hierarchy:\n",
    "   - The exceptions derived from `BaseException` are usually used for system-level events or conditions that may require program termination or special handling.\n",
    "   - The exceptions derived from `Exception` are generally used for application-level errors or exceptional conditions that can be caught and handled within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is best practice to catch and handle exceptions based on the specific types of errors you expect and need to handle. Catching `Exception` allows you to handle most common exceptions without catching system-level exceptions that may require special treatment. However, there may be cases where you want to catch more general exceptions by using `BaseException` or catch specific subclasses of `Exception` for more precise error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that catching and handling exceptions should be done judiciously, focusing on specific exceptions that your code is designed to handle, rather than catching all exceptions indiscriminately."

    "## try-except-else, try-finally\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try` statement is used in combination with `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions and perform specific actions. Here's an overview of `try-except-else` and `try-finally` constructs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try-except-else`:\n",
    "   The `try-except-else` statement allows you to catch and handle exceptions, as well as execute code that should run only if no exceptions are raised within the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "       result = some_function()\n",
    "   except SomeException:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "       handle_exception()\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code to execute if no exception occurs\n",
    "       process_result(result)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `try` block contains code that may raise an exception. If the specified exception (`SomeException` in this case) is raised, the corresponding `except` block is executed to handle the exception. If no exception occurs, the `else` block is executed to perform additional operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `try-finally`:\n",
    "   The `try-finally` statement is used to ensure that a specific block of code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations, such as releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "       perform_operation()\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that always runs, even if an exception occurs\n",
    "       cleanup()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `try` block contains code that may raise an exception. The `finally` block is guaranteed to execute, whether an exception occurs or not. It is useful for tasks like closing files, releasing locks, or cleaning up connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `try-except-else` and `try-finally` blocks can be used independently or in combination within the same `try` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except-else` construct allows you to handle exceptions and define separate code paths for successful execution, while the `try-finally` construct ensures that specified cleanup operations are performed, regardless of exceptions. These constructs provide flexibility and control over exception handling and resource management in your code."

    "## assert exception\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `assert` statement is used to check whether a given condition is `True`. If the condition evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` exception is raised. The `assert` statement is often used for debugging and to validate assumptions in your code. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert condition, message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `condition`: The expression or condition that is checked. If it evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n",
    "- `message` (optional): A string that provides additional information about the assertion. It is displayed as part of the error message when the assertion fails. This argument is commonly used to provide a descriptive message about the assertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an `assert` statement is encountered, Python evaluates the given condition. If the condition is `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised. If the condition is `True`, the execution continues without any interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the use of `assert` statements is primarily intended for debugging and should not be relied upon for handling expected errors or exceptions in production code. It is recommended to use explicit `try-except` blocks to handle expected exceptions and provide appropriate error handling and feedback to users."

    "\n",
    "In Python, you can raise exceptions explicitly using the `raise` statement. Raising an exception allows you to indicate that an error or exceptional condition has occurred during the execution of your program. Here's how you can raise exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raise a built-in exception**:\n",
    "   You can raise any of the built-in exception types or their derived classes. The `raise` statement is followed by the exception class or an instance of the exception class.\n",

    "## Tracebacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when an exception occurs during the execution of a program, the traceback information provides valuable details about the error, including the sequence of function calls that led to the exception. The traceback helps in understanding the cause and location of the error, making it easier to debug and fix issues.\n",

    "Python provides the `traceback` module as part of the standard library, which allows you to work with and manipulate traceback information programmatically. Here's an overview of how you can use the `traceback` module and handle exceptions to obtain more information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling exceptions: When an exception is raised, you can catch and handle it using a try-except block. The except block allows you to access the exception object, which contains information about the error. You can print the exception message or perform other actions based on the exception type.\n",

    "    # Handle the exception\n",
    "    print(f\"An exception occurred: {str(e)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Printing traceback: To get more detailed information about the exception, including the traceback, you can use the `traceback.format_exc()` function from the `traceback` module. This function returns a formatted string containing the traceback information.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import traceback\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",

    "## Exceptions Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception chaining in Python allows you to associate multiple exceptions together, creating a chain of exceptions that provides a more comprehensive view of the error's origin and context. This feature was introduced in Python 3.x to improve error handling and make it easier to understand the cause of an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, it may be necessary to propagate the original exception while adding additional information or context-specific details. Exception chaining allows you to capture and preserve the original exception while raising a new exception that incorporates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the chained exception is raised, the traceback will include both the original exception and the new exception, providing a complete picture of the error propagation path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception chaining is useful in scenarios where you want to provide more meaningful and informative error messages without losing the context of the original exception. It helps maintain the integrity of the error flow and allows for better understanding and debugging of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all exceptions are chainable by default. Only exceptions derived from the base `Exception` class or its subclasses support exception chaining. When defining custom exceptions, you can ensure they are chainable by inheriting from the appropriate exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, exception chaining in Python enables you to build a hierarchy of exceptions, preserving the original exception's information while adding additional context-specific details.

    "# Debugging in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs in your code. Python provides several built-in tools and techniques to help with debugging. Here are some common approaches to debugging in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Print statements**:\n",
    "   One of the simplest ways to debug your code is by adding print statements at various points to display the values of variables and track the flow of execution. You can print out the values of variables, function calls, and other relevant information to understand the behavior of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   print(\"Value of x:\", x)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logging**:\n",
    "   The logging module in Python allows you to write log messages at different levels of severity. It provides a flexible and customizable way to track the execution flow and log useful information during program execution. Logging is especially useful for long-running applications or server-side programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   logger.debug(\"Value of x: %s\", x)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debugging tools**:\n",
    "   Python offers various debugging tools that provide more advanced features for troubleshooting code. The `pdb` module is a built-in debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables interactively. There are also external debugging tools like `pdb++`, `PyCharm`, `VS Code` with Python extensions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (using `pdb`):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "   def divide(x, y):\n",
    "       result = x / y\n",
    "       return result\n",
    "\n",
    "   pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   y = 0\n",
    "   result = divide(x, y)\n",
    "   print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exception traceback**:\n",
    "   When an exception occurs, Python provides a traceback that shows the sequence of function calls leading to the exception. The traceback helps identify the exact line of code where the error occurred and the call stack leading to that point.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Usage**:\n",
    "   Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs in your code. It involves analyzing the code's execution, inspecting variables, and identifying the root cause of errors or unexpected behavior. Debugging is crucial for troubleshooting and improving the reliability and correctness of your Python programs. It can be done interactively during development or in a production environment to diagnose issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Types of Debugging**:\n",
    "   There are different types of debugging techniques you can use in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Print Statements: Adding print statements in your code to output the values of variables or specific execution points. This allows you to trace the program's flow and inspect intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Debugging Tools: Python provides built-in debugging tools like `pdb` (Python Debugger) and `pdb++` (an enhanced version of `pdb`). These tools allow you to set breakpoints, step through code execution, examine variables, and interactively debug your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Python IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and PyDev offer powerful debugging features. They provide a graphical interface for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and analyzing program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Logging: Incorporating logging statements throughout your code to record important information, errors, or events. You can configure logging levels to control the verbosity of the log output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remote Debugging**:\n",
    "   Remote debugging refers to the process of debugging code that is executed on a remote system or environment. It allows you to connect to a remote Python process and debug it as if it were running locally. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the issue or error occurs in a remote deployment or production environment. Remote debugging can be achieved using various tools and techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Remote Debugging Tools: Some IDEs and debugging frameworks provide support for remote debugging. They allow you to connect to a remote Python process, set breakpoints, and debug the code remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Debugging Protocols: Python supports debugging protocols like the Remote Debugging Protocol (RDP) or the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), which enable remote debugging across different environments or platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - SSH Tunnelling: Using secure shell (SSH) tunnelling, you can establish a secure connection between your local machine and the remote system. This allows you to forward the debugging-related communications and access the remote Python process from your local debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's worth noting that remote debugging may require additional setup and configuration, and access to the remote environment may have certain restrictions or limitations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to debugging in Python, understanding the concept of logging levels is crucial. Logging levels define the severity or importance of log messages and help you control which messages are displayed or recorded based on their level. Python's logging module provides the following standard logging levels, listed in increasing order of severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging purposes. Typically used to track the flow and state of the program, including variable values, function calls, and intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **INFO**: General information about the program's execution. This level is used to provide status updates, progress information, or significant events during the program's operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WARNING**: Indication of potential issues or unexpected behavior that may need attention. It signifies that something unexpected has occurred, but the program can still continue to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ERROR**: Indicates errors in the program that caused it to malfunction or fail to perform a specific operation. These errors can affect the program's behavior but might not necessarily lead to a termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CRITICAL**: Critical errors or exceptional events that may lead to program termination or significant failures. These errors indicate severe issues that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate logging level depends on the purpose and context of your debugging. Here are some guidelines to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For general debugging and information tracking, use the `DEBUG` level. It provides detailed insights into the program's behavior and helps trace the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `INFO` level for important updates or milestones during the program's execution. These messages can give an overview of the program's progress and significant events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `WARNING` level to highlight potential issues or unexpected behavior that may affect the program's functionality or performance. It helps identify areas that require attention or further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `ERROR` level to log actual errors or failures that prevent the program from performing a specific operation or produce incorrect results. These messages can aid in troubleshooting and fixing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reserve the `CRITICAL` level for exceptional events or severe errors that require immediate attention. These messages often indicate critical failures or conditions that may lead to a program's termination or significant impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "During debugging, it's common to start with a higher logging level like DEBUG and gradually increase it to higher levels based on the severity of issues encountered. This allows you to fine-tune the amount of information you receive and focus on the most critical aspects of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure the logging level in your Python code, you can use the `basicConfig` method from the logging module, or configure it programmatically using the `setLevel` method on individual loggers or handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging level\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "logging.debug('This is a debug message')\n",
    "logging.info('This is an info message')\n",
    "logging.warning('This is a warning message')\n",
    "logging.error('This is an error message')\n",
    "logging.critical('This is a critical message')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the logging level is set to DEBUG, which means all log messages of DEBUG level and above will be displayed or recorded. You can modify the logging level to suit your debugging needs by using one of the standard logging levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting appropriate logging levels, you can control the amount of information generated during debugging and focus on the severity levels that are most relevant to your debugging process."

    "## Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the logging module provides extensive customization options that allow you to configure the behavior, format, and destination of log messages. This customization helps you tailor the logging output to your specific needs. Here are some common customization options available in the logging module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log Levels: The logging module supports different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. You can control the level of log messages displayed by setting the appropriate level for your logger. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the logger is set to display log messages with a level of DEBUG or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Log Formatting: You can customize the format of log messages using the `Formatter` class from the logging module. You can specify various attributes like timestamp, log level, module name, and the actual log message in the desired format. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\n",
    "handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "logger.addHandler(handler)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, a `StreamHandler` is used to display log messages to the console, and a custom formatter is set to specify the desired log message format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Log Handlers: The logging module provides different handlers to control the destination of log messages. You can direct log messages to the console, files, or other destinations based on your requirements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "file_handler = logging.FileHandler(\"log_file.log\")\n",
    "logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, a `FileHandler` is added to the logger to write log messages to a file named \"log_file.log\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log Filtering: You can implement custom filters to selectively process log messages based on specific criteria. Filters allow you to control which log messages are emitted and which are discarded. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomFilter(logging.Filter):\n",
    "    def filter(self, record):\n",
    "        # Implement your custom filtering logic here\n",
    "        return record.levelno == logging.ERROR\n",
    "\n",
    "filter_obj = CustomFilter()\n",
    "logger.addFilter(filter_obj)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, a custom filter is created to only allow log messages with a level of ERROR to be emitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these customization options and combining them as needed, you can tailor the logging output to match your specific requirements. This allows you to control the level of detail, format, destination, and filtering of log messages in your Python applications, making the logging output more informative and suitable for your use case."

It involves gathering information about the program's execution, such as the amount of time spent in different functions or sections of code, memory usage, and other metrics. The goal of profiling is to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize code, and improve the overall efficiency of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling provides insights into how the program is utilizing system resources, helping developers identify areas of the code that can be optimized or improved. It helps answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which functions or methods are consuming the most time or resources?\n",
    "- How much time is spent in each function or code block?\n",
    "- How many times are certain code sections executed?\n",
    "- What is the memory usage of the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling can be especially useful when dealing with large or complex applications, as it allows developers to pinpoint performance issues and focus optimization efforts on the critical areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in tools and libraries for profiling, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. cProfile: The `cProfile` module is a built-in Python profiler that provides detailed profiling information on the function-level. It records the number of times each function is called and the time spent in each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. timeit: The `timeit` module allows you to measure the execution time of small code snippets or functions. It is useful for micro-benchmarks and comparing the performance of different code alternatives.\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling in Python is the process of analyzing the performance of your code to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and improve overall efficiency. It helps you understand how different parts of your program consume time and resources, allowing you to make informed decisions for optimization. Here's a brief overview of profiling usage in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Profiling: Python provides a built-in module called `cProfile` for basic profiling. It allows you to measure the execution time of different functions and statements in your code. You can use the `cProfile` module to profile your code by executing it within a profiling context. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cProfile\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # Code to be profiled\n",
    "\n",
    "cProfile.run(\"my_function()\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code runs `my_function()` and generates a profile report showing the time spent in each function and its sub-functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Line Profiling: Line profiling provides more detailed information by profiling each line of code individually. The `line_profiler` package is commonly used for line profiling in Python. You can annotate the functions or lines you want to profile using the `@profile` decorator and then execute your code with the line profiler. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from line_profiler import LineProfiler\n",
    "\n",
    "@profile\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # Code to be profiled\n",
    "\n",
    "profiler = LineProfiler()\n",
    "profiler.add_function(my_function)\n",
    "profiler.run(\"my_function()\")\n",
    "profiler.print_stats()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `@profile` decorator is used to indicate the function to be profiled. The `LineProfiler` object is then used to run and collect line-by-line profiling data. Finally, the `print_stats()` method displays the profiling results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Memory Profiling: Memory profiling helps identify memory usage patterns in your code. The `memory_profiler` package is commonly used for memory profiling in Python. It allows you to annotate functions or code blocks using the `@profile` decorator and then execute your code with the memory profiler. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from memory_profiler import profile\n",
    "\n",
    "@profile\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # Code to be profiled\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `@profile` decorator is used to indicate the function to be memory profiled. When the function is executed, the memory profiler tracks the memory usage and displays the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Advanced Profiling: In addition to the basic profiling techniques mentioned above, there are more advanced profiling tools and techniques available in Python, such as `py-spy`, `snakeviz`, and `pyinstrument`. These tools offer more advanced features like CPU sampling, flame graphs, visualization, and real-time profiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling helps you identify performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and areas for optimization in your code. By analyzing the profiling results, you can make informed decisions to optimize critical sections, improve algorithm efficiency, reduce memory consumption, and enhance the overall performance of your Python applications."

    "## Static and dynamic profilers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of profiling in Python, there are two main types of profilers: static and dynamic profilers. Here's an overview of each type:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Static Profilers**: Static profilers analyze your code without actually executing it. They inspect the source code or compiled bytecode to gather information about the program's structure, function calls, and resource usage. Static profilers can provide valuable insights into potential performance issues, such as inefficient algorithms or resource-intensive operations. However, they don't capture runtime information and can't provide accurate measurements of execution time or memory usage. Examples of static profilers in Python include Pylint and Pyflakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Profilers**: Dynamic profilers analyze your code during runtime, collecting data on function calls, execution time, memory usage, and other performance metrics. They provide a more accurate representation of how your code behaves in real-world scenarios. Dynamic profilers can help identify performance bottlenecks, optimize critical sections, and detect memory leaks. They often generate detailed reports or visualizations that highlight areas for improvement. Python provides several dynamic profiling tools, such as cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler, and py-spy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static profilers are useful for identifying potential issues in your codebase, such as unused variables, syntax errors, or adherence to coding standards. They are commonly used as part of code analysis and linting processes to ensure code quality. On the other hand, dynamic profilers are essential for in-depth performance analysis, optimizing critical sections, and fine-tuning your code for better efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that dynamic profilers introduce some overhead due to the instrumentation and data collection during runtime. Therefore, they may slightly affect the execution time and resource usage of your program. However, the insights gained from dynamic profiling often outweigh the overhead, as they enable you to make targeted optimizations based on real-time measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both static and dynamic profilers have their place in the software development process. Static profilers can help improve code quality and adherence to best practices, while dynamic profilers provide valuable performance insights and optimizations. Depending on your specific needs, you can choose the appropriate profiler or combine multiple profilers to gain a comprehensive understanding of your code's behavior and performance."

    "1. `resources.getrusage(resource)`\n",
    "   - This function returns a named tuple containing information about the system resource usage for the current process.\n",
    "   - The `resource` argument specifies the type of resource you want to measure. Some commonly used resource types are:\n",
    "     - `resources.RUSAGE_SELF`: Measures the resource usage of the current process.\n",
    "     - `resources.RUSAGE_CHILDREN`: Measures the resource usage of child processes spawned by the current process.\n",
    "   - The returned named tuple contains various attributes representing different resource usage metrics, such as `ru_utime` (user CPU time), `ru_stime` (system CPU time), `ru_maxrss` (maximum resident set size), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `resources.getpagesize()`\n",
    "   - This function returns the system's memory page size in bytes. It can be useful for calculating memory usage based on the number of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of the `resources` module to measure CPU time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import resources\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measure CPU time\n",
    "start_time = time.process_time()\n",
    "# Code to be profiled\n",
    "end_time = time.process_time()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate CPU time\n",
    "cpu_time = end_time - start_time\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"CPU time: {cpu_time} seconds\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `time.process_time()` function is used to measure the CPU time before and after the code segment you want to profile. The difference between the start and end time gives you the CPU time elapsed during the execution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the `resources` module provides low-level resource usage information, and the accuracy and availability of certain metrics may vary depending on the operating system and platform. For more advanced and comprehensive profiling, you might consider using dedicated profiling tools like `cProfile` or third-party libraries such as `psutil` or `py-spy`, which provide more detailed insights into CPU, memory, and other resource usage."
