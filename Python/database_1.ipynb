    "# RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "An RDBMS is a software system that allows you to create, manage, and maintain relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. To interact with the database, you use a structured query language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language that can be used to interact with RDBMSs. There are several Python libraries and modules available that provide easy-to-use interfaces for interacting with databases, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM. These libraries allow you to create, read, update, and delete data from the database using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python to interact with an RDBMS can be useful for a variety of applications, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning. For example, you might use Python and an RDBMS to store and analyze data for an e-commerce website or to train a machine learning model on large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an RDBMS is a software system for managing relational databases, and Python is a popular programming language that can be used to interact with RDBMSs and manipulate data stored in them.\n",

    "## Tables, Columns, Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, data is stored in tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A table it's like a spreadsheet with rows and columns.\n",
    "- Columns are like the headers in a spreadsheet, and each column has a specific type of data, such as text, numbers, or dates.\n",
    "- Rows are like the individual rows in a spreadsheet, and each row contains the actual data for a specific record.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, tables organize data into columns and rows, making it easy to manage and retrieve large amounts of structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relations (Primary key, Foreign key)\n",
    "\n",
    "A relation in a relational database is a table that contains data. A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys are used to ensure that each row in the table is unique and can be used to reference that row from other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. Foreign keys establish relationships between tables and are used to enforce referential integrity, which means that each reference to a row in another table is valid and points to an existing row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers (id),\n",
    "  order_date DATE,\n",
    "  total_price DECIMAL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Views\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. A view is created by selecting data from one or more tables, and it appears to the user as if it were a separate table in the database. However, unlike a table, a view does not actually store data itself; it simply provides a way to access data from one or more tables in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are useful because they allow you to simplify complex queries, present data in a customized way, or restrict access to sensitive data. For example, you might create a view that only shows certain columns from a table, or that filters data based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to simplifying queries and customizing data access, views can also help improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the underlying tables. This is because a view only retrieves data from the underlying tables that is needed to satisfy the query that defines the view."

    "\n",
    "The INSERT statement in SQL is used to insert new data into a table. It allows you to add one or more rows of data to a table. The INSERT statement typically includes the name of the table you want to insert data into, and a list of values that correspond to each column in the table.\n",
