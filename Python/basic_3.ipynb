    "In Python, the terms strong typing and weak typing are often used interchangeably with dynamic typing and static typing. Python is dynamically typed, which means that the interpreter infers the data type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. Python enforces strong typing because type errors will raise exceptions at runtime if the interpreter detects that an operation cannot be performed on a certain data type.\n",
