However, if the original object contains other objects or nested data structures, those objects will not be copied but rather their references will be copied to the new object. This means that changes made to those objects in the new object will also affect the original object.\n",

It creates a new object with a new memory address, and copies the references to the elements from the original object to the new object. Any changes made to the elements of the new object will also affect the elements of the original object, but changes to the object itself will not."
