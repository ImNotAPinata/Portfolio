    "# DATABASE GUIDE\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are an important concept in databases that ensure the consistency, durability, and isolation of changes made to the data. Transactions are used to group one or more database operations (such as inserts, updates, and deletes) into a single, atomic unit of work. This allows the changes to be either committed to the database or rolled back in case of errors or failures. ACID ensures the integrity of data within a single database system, while CAP relates to the trade-offs that must be made when designing distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ACID\n",
    "\n",
    "This acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are the four key properties that transactions must have to ensure the integrity of the data in a database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: Atomicity refers to the idea that a transaction is an indivisible unit of work. Either all of the changes made by a transaction are committed to the database, or none of them are. This ensures that the database remains consistent and that data is not left in an incomplete or invalid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Consistency refers to the idea that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. This means that the data will always be in a valid and expected state after the transaction completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Isolation refers to the idea that transactions are isolated from each other, meaning that one transaction cannot interfere with another. This ensures that multiple transactions can be executed concurrently without interfering with each other. There are several isolation levels, each with its own trade-offs in terms of consistency, concurrency, and performance. The most common isolation levels are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Read Uncommitted: This is the lowest isolation level, where transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This level allows for the highest degree of concurrency but can result in inconsistent data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Read Committed: This isolation level ensures that transactions can only see changes that have been committed by other transactions. This level provides a higher degree of consistency than Read Uncommitted but can still result in some inconsistencies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Repeatable Read: This level ensures that a transaction can see the same data each time it reads from the database, even if other transactions have made changes to the data. This level provides a higher degree of consistency but can result in more overhead and lower concurrency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Serializable: This is the highest isolation level, where transactions are executed as if they were executed one after the other in a serial manner. This level provides the highest degree of consistency but can result in the lowest concurrency and highest overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Durability**: Durability refers to the idea that once a transaction has been committed, its changes will persist even in the event of a system failure or crash. This ensures that the database can recover from failures without losing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CAP\n",
    "\n",
    "This acronym stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. These are the three key properties that are associated with distributed systems and relate to the trade-offs that must be made when designing such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Consistency refers to the idea that all nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Availability**: Availability refers to the idea that every request to the system receives a response, without guaranteeing that it contains the most recent version of the data or a consistent view of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partition tolerance**: Partition tolerance refers to the idea that the system continues to function even when network partitions occur, meaning that communication between nodes is lost or delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can only provide two of these guarantees at the same time. For example, a system that prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance may not be able to provide high availability, while a system that prioritizes availability and partition tolerance may sacrifice consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP theorem is often used as a guideline when designing distributed systems. It is important to carefully consider which guarantees are most important for a particular use case, and to choose a system architecture that meets those requirements while taking into account the limitations of the CAP theorem."

    "# RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "An RDBMS is a software system that allows you to create, manage, and maintain relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. To interact with the database, you use a structured query language (SQL). \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, an RDBMS is a software system for managing relational databases, and Python is a popular programming language that can be used to interact with RDBMSs and manipulate data stored in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tables, Columns, Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, data is stored in tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A table it's like a spreadsheet with rows and columns.\n",
    "- Columns are like the headers in a spreadsheet, and each column has a specific type of data, such as text, numbers, or dates.\n",
    "- Rows are like the individual rows in a spreadsheet, and each row contains the actual data for a specific record.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, tables organize data into columns and rows, making it easy to manage and retrieve large amounts of structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relations (Primary key, Foreign key)\n",
    "\n",
    "A relation in a relational database is a table that contains data. A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys are used to ensure that each row in the table is unique and can be used to reference that row from other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. Foreign keys establish relationships between tables and are used to enforce referential integrity, which means that each reference to a row in another table is valid and points to an existing row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers (id),\n",
    "  order_date DATE,\n",
    "  total_price DECIMAL\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Views\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. A view is created by selecting data from one or more tables, and it appears to the user as if it were a separate table in the database. However, unlike a table, a view does not actually store data itself; it simply provides a way to access data from one or more tables in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are useful because they allow you to simplify complex queries, present data in a customized way, or restrict access to sensitive data. For example, you might create a view that only shows certain columns from a table, or that filters data based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to simplifying queries and customizing data access, views can also help improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the underlying tables. This is because a view only retrieves data from the underlying tables that is needed to satisfy the query that defines the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS\n",
    "SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "INNER JOIN orders\n",
    "ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cursors\n",
    "\n",
    "In database management systems, a cursor is a mechanism that allows applications to traverse through the results of a database query one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cursor is created when a query is executed and it maintains a current position within the result set. Applications can use cursors to fetch the data from the database one row at a time, and to perform operations on each row before moving on to the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursors can be useful when dealing with large result sets or when the application needs to perform complex operations on the data. They provide a way for the application to efficiently process the data without loading the entire result set into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of cursors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward-only cursor: This type of cursor can only move forward through the result set and can only read each row once.\n",
    "- Scrollable cursor: This type of cursor allows for movement in any direction and can read each row multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursors can be created and managed using SQL statements or using programming languages such as Python that have database connectivity libraries. It is important to use cursors carefully, as they can impact performance and resource usage. Cursors should be closed when they are no longer needed to free up resources and prevent memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Store Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures and functions are database objects that are used to encapsulate a set of database operations and logic that can be reused by different applications or users. They are pre-compiled database code that can be called by other applications or database objects, and are stored on the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE usp_GetCustomerOrders\n",
    "    @CustomerId int\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId\n",
    "END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are similar to stored procedures, but they return a value rather than modifying data in the database. They can be used to perform calculations, evaluate conditions, or manipulate data before returning a result to the caller. Functions can also have input and output parameters, and can be used in queries or other functions to perform complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers (x INT, y INT) RETURNS INT\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE result INT;\n",
    "    SET result = x + y;\n",
    "    RETURN result;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "In a database, an index is a data structure that contains a copy of the data from one or more columns of a table, along with a pointer to the location of the actual data in the table. When a query is executed, the database can use the index to quickly find the rows that match the query criteria, without having to scan the entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes can be created on one or more columns of a table, and can be used to improve the performance of queries that filter, sort, or group data. They can also be used to enforce unique constraints on the data, and to improve the performance of join operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, indexes are a powerful tool for optimizing database performance, but they should be used carefully and judiciously to ensure that they provide a real performance benefit for the queries that are being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers are database objects that are automatically executed in response to certain database events, such as data modifications (inserts, updates, and deletes), or changes to database schema. They are used to implement complex business logic and data consistency checks that cannot be easily achieved with constraints or other database features.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER check_salary\n",
    "BEFORE INSERT ON employees\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "  DECLARE min_salary INT;\n",
    "  SELECT MIN(salary) INTO min_salary FROM employees;\n",
    "  IF NEW.salary < min_salary THEN\n",
    "    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary too low';\n",
    "  END IF;\n",

    "\n",
    "The merge/upsert operation starts with a source table and a target table. The source table contains the data to be inserted or updated, and the target table is the destination where the data is to be inserted or updated. The merge/upsert operation compares the data in the source and target tables and determines which rows should be inserted, updated, or deleted.\n",

    "- DISTINCT: Distinct is a keyword that can be used with an aggregation function to remove duplicates before applying the function.\n",
    "- WINDOWS FUNCTIONS: Window functions are another type of function that can be used with aggregations. Window functions allow you to perform calculations on a subset of rows in a table, based on a defined window or range. \n",
    "    - COUNT: Returns the number of rows in a table or the number of non-null values in a column.\n",
    "    - SUM: Returns the sum of all values in a column.\n",
    "    - AVG: Returns the average of all values in a column.\n",
    "    - MAX: Returns the maximum value in a column.\n",
    "    - MIN: Returns the minimum value in a column.\n",

    "Database normalization is the process of organizing a database in such a way that it reduces data redundancy and dependency, and improves data integrity. There are several normal forms that are commonly used to achieve these goals, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: This is the most basic level of normalization, which requires that each column in a table contain only atomic values (i.e., values that cannot be further subdivided).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: This form requires that all non-key attributes of a table be dependent on the entire primary key, rather than just a part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: This form requires that all non-key attributes of a table be dependent only on the primary key, and not on any other non-key attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: This form is a stronger version of 3NF, which requires that all functional dependencies in a table be determined by the candidate keys, rather than just the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: This form is used when there are multiple independent many-to-many relationships between the same two entities in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**: This form is used when there are complex multi-valued dependencies between attributes in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each normal form builds upon the previous one, and each one has its own set of rules and requirements that must be followed in order to achieve it. Normalization helps to improve the efficiency and accuracy of a database, while also making it easier to maintain and update over time."
