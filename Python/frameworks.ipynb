    "**Active Record vs Mapper Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Record and Mapper Pattern are two different design patterns used in object-relational mapping (ORM) to represent the relationship between objects and their database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Active Record pattern is an ORM pattern that maps a database table to a class, where each instance of the class represents a row in the table. The class contains methods to retrieve, create, update, and delete records in the database. The pattern is straightforward and easy to use, as it encapsulates the database operations within the model class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mapper Pattern is an ORM pattern that separates the database mapping logic from the domain model. In this pattern, each class has a corresponding mapper class that is responsible for mapping the object to the database table. The mapper class contains the code to insert, update, delete, and retrieve records from the database, while the domain model is responsible for defining the business logic of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between the Active Record and Mapper Pattern depends on the complexity of the application and the requirements for data access. Active Record is a simpler pattern and is best suited for small to medium-sized applications with simple database requirements, while the Mapper Pattern is better suited for larger and more complex applications with complex business logic and database requirements."

    "**What for ORM is needed for, why not raw SQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, which is a technique used to map data from a relational database to objects in an object-oriented programming language, such as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORM provides an abstraction layer between the database and the application, which makes it easier to work with the database using the programming language. With ORM, you can interact with the database using high-level objects and methods, which can simplify database access and reduce the amount of code you need to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of ORM is that it can help you avoid writing raw SQL queries, which can be error-prone and difficult to maintain, especially for complex database operations. ORM provides a more intuitive and convenient way to interact with the database, which can improve the developer's productivity and make the code more maintainable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, ORM can provide an additional layer of security by preventing SQL injection attacks, which can occur when user input is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization. ORM libraries typically handle input validation and sanitization automatically, which can help protect the application from security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, ORM can provide a number of benefits for working with databases in Python, including easier database access, reduced code complexity, improved maintainability, and increased security."

    "**Migrations, An Overview of Tools (Alembic, Django Migration)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Migrations are used in software development to manage changes to a database schema over time. When changes are made to the structure of a database (adding or removing tables, modifying columns, etc.), these changes need to be propagated to all environments where the application is deployed, such as development, staging, and production. Migrations are a way to automate this process and ensure that the database schema is consistent across all environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Migrations typically involve creating a set of scripts that describe the changes to the database schema. Each script represents a single migration, and includes SQL statements or code that modifies the database schema. Migrations are applied in a sequential order, with each migration building upon the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several migration tools available for Python-based projects, including Alembic and Django Migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Alembic` is a lightweight database migration tool that is often used with the SQLAlchemy ORM. Alembic allows developers to define database schema changes using Python code, and includes features such as automatic generation of migration scripts, versioning of schema changes, and support for multiple database backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Django Migrations`, on the other hand, are a built-in feature of the Django web framework. Django Migrations allow developers to define database schema changes using Python code or by running database schema updates from the Django command line interface. Like Alembic, Django Migrations also includes support for versioning of schema changes, and can be used with multiple database backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Alembic and Django Migrations provide a convenient way to manage database schema changes in a structured and repeatable manner, which can save developers time and reduce the risk of errors when deploying changes to production environments."
