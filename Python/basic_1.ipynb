    "- Floating-point numbers: Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers, such as 1.0, -3.14, 2.71828, etc. In Python, floating-point numbers are represented using the \"float\" type, which is implemented using the IEEE 754 standard.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Decimal: Decimal numbers are represented using the standard base-10 system, which is the most common number system used in everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal numbers are represented using the base-16 system, which uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent numbers from 0-15. Hexadecimal numbers are often used to represent colors and memory addresses.\n",

    "- Octal: Octal numbers are represented using the base-8 system, which uses the digits 0-7 to represent numbers from 0-7.\n",

    "- Binary: Binary numbers are represented using the base-2 system, which uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent numbers.\n",
    "\n",
